## Goal: Understand the overall structure of the IACS CSMS structure laid out in IEC/ISA 2-1, so that can crossreference quickly if needed. The details are seemingly too extensive to memorize in comparison to the value they bring for the knowledge examinated.

## NIST 800-82r3:
- Chapter 3

## NIST 800-61
- The full publication.

## IEC/ISA 62443-2-1:
- Figure 1 - good overview of the process.

## IEC/ISA 62443-1-1:
- Section 6.6

## Mike Holcomb:

## Core concepts mentioned in the SANS course syllabus:  
_The note "chapter" refers to the "Practical Industrial Cyber Security" book._
- Security policy implementation 
- Building an ICS Cyber Security Program
- Starting the Process -> "CSMS initiate program".
- Frameworks: ISA/IEC 62443, ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF
- Using the NIST CSF
- Creating ICS Cyber Security Policy
- Policies, Standards, Guidance, and Procedures -> describe the role of each.
- Culture and Enforcement 
- Examples and Sources
- Exercise: ICS Security Policy Review
- Industry-specific compliance testing
- Change management: why itâ€™s critical in ICS.
