# GICSP

This repo is a self-study guide for the GICSP(Industrial Cyber Security Certification).  
It is mainly a reference manual, pointing towards various material that I found relevant when studying for the GICSP. It also includes notes regarding topics that I found particularly interesting.  
NOTE: This guide is written from the point-of-view of someone with a Linux/InfoSec/Networking background. This may affect its relevance for individuals with other backgrounds.  

#[Step 0](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/blob/main/study-topics.md) - Overview of the guide's main resources.

#[Step 1](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/tree/main/intro-stage) - Initial Overview of Available Material, and CISA training resources. Goal being to understand what OT systems are, major related components/concepts, and how OT differs from IT.

#Step 2 - ICS Components & Architecture

#Step 3 - ICS Overview & Concepts

#[Step 4](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/tree/main/industrial-protocols) - Protocols, Communications, & Compromises

#Step 5 - PERA Level 0 & 1 Technology Overview and Compromise

#Step 6 - PERA Level 2 & 3 Technology Overview and Compromise

#Step 7 - ICS Program & Policy Development

#Step 8 - Intelligence Gathering & Threat Modeling

#Step 9 - Risk Based Disaster Recovery & Incident Response

#Step 10 - Wireless Technologies & Compromises

#[ICS Project](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/tree/main/ICS-project) - A project that aims to simulate an OT+IT environment, based on Purdue Model.

#[ICS Case Studies](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/tree/main/case-studies) - Some case studies I've done on ICS security related incidents.

#[Labs](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/tree/main/labs) - Link to various lab environments that I found when researching this project.

#[Indexing](https://github.com/antonw-88/GICSP/tree/main/indexing-methodology) - Various resources for suggested indexing. During initial research, the indexing was repeatedly mentioned as being very important. 

The motivation for the repo was that I couldn't find a fully comprehensive and we structured self-study guide for the GICSP. While a well reputed SANS course exists, it is very expensive. Since I find both OT, the intersection of IT/OT, and security interesting, I decided to create a guide myself. I've also wanted to give back to the opensource community for a long time, and this feels like a hopefully good way to do so. I would like to give special thanks to Manjunath Hiregange, whose Youtube video "How to Prepare for GICSP Certification Without SANS Training" provided a very good initial overview of where to find relevant resources and how to think about the process. Usman Shahzad's Linkedin post regarding his self studies, was also very helpful(https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-journey-achieving-gicsp-certification-through-usman-das9f). I would recommend to give both a look. Finally, significant use of ChatGPT was made during the initial phase; to understand the exam itself, identify related critical concepts, and to gather reference material. 

The informational base for this guide, consists of mainly SANS and NIST resources. A note in relation to this, is that the official books for the exam, that are provided with the SANS course, seemingly contain the exact same sentences that can be found on the actual exam. One Reddit user wrote: "I couldn't imagine a SANS test without the associated books. Literally the questions are taken from the books". This may first seem demotivating, but it made it even more clear to me that a well-structured and comprehensive self-study guide should exist. The GICSP is frequently referenced in job adverts, and OT/IT security is seemingly becoming more and more important. Additionally, by not having the SANS books, it may also require a both deeper and broader understanding of the topics. In the end, the true goal is the learning aspect itself, and then bringing that knowledge into the external world.

The structure of the repo is based on the official GIAC syllabus(https://www.giac.org/certifications/global-industrial-cyber-security-professional-gicsp/). For each of the concepts/keywords/etc, sections in books; videos; labs; etc, are referenced. During the initial research for this project, it was identified that an in-depth indexing of information is very important since the exam is open-book. See the diagram below for an overview of the guide(ha rutor för varje sektion, med pilar till subsektioner, med pilar till specifika koncept/processer/enheter. Allt numrerat och leder vidare till specifika referenser.). The indexing will not be provided, since that would somewhat undermine the learning purpose. However, a guide created by lala can be found under the "Indexing Methodology" section.

The repo will be continually updated, for example with summaries of SANS webinars related to ICS and how they map to the IGCSP syllabus. 

I've used a large number of references during repeated information gathering phases. If I've used material that you created, but haven't referenced that, let me know and I will. Or you can send a pull request.

The exam costs around 900 euros, and an official testexam can be taken via SANS for around 400 euros.

Note that the SANS webpage is full of valuable information that is freely available. It is also possible to register and join regulary held ICS security webinars etc.

Finally, I found this blogpost to be a good introduction to the certification process. It also references the importance of indexing: "I knew exactly what questions I got wrong. The ones I couldn’t look up in my index, the ones I was overthinking". (https://baston.uk/gicsp-how-to-pass-first-time/)
