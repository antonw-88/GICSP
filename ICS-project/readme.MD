Project to be designed and documented/motivated, using the Purdue Model(for clear overview), Zero Trust, DiD(clear layer identification with zones and conduits), policies. The infrastructure design will be influenced by a case study. First an architecture that aims to reflect the design before compromise, and then one that aims to defend the infrastructure against the compromise. Design decisions will be referenced to IEC 62443 and NIST 800-82.  
The goal is to understand better both from a theoretical and practical point-of-view what happened; what could have been done better; etc.
