# ICS IT/OT Project
Project to be designed and documented/motivated, using the Purdue Model(for clear overview), Zero Trust, DiD(clear layer identification with zones and conduits), policies. The infrastructure design will be influenced by a case study. First an architecture that aims to reflect the design before compromise, and then one that aims to defend the infrastructure against the compromise. Design decisions will be referenced to IEC 62443 and NIST 800-82.
The goal is to understand better both from a theoretical and practical point-of-view what happened in the case study scenario; what could have been done better; etc.

### The project will include:
- One scenario for each of the 16 ICS sectors.
- An IR runbook for the scenario.
- Policy section aimed at defending against the compromise.
- The aim with the architectures is not for them to be fully comprehensive, but focus on the events that occurred, and the more unique properties of such IT/OT environments. For example, all such environments should probably have AAA servers, but not all might use RTUs.
- Labs that reflect what happened?
- Use of ICS Killchain and Mitre ICS ATT&CK, to analyze what happened in a structured manner.
- Use directives from page 142 in 62443-2-1, to establish a CSMS.
- Project to be built around energy/water/wind sector to learn about scada and since energy is of core importance to all other ICS sectors.
