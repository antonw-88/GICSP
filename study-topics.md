# CORE MATERIAL
This section is aimed at providing a concise overview of the material that seems the absolutely most relevant/vital for GICSP exam preparation. 

## INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW MATERIAL
The CISA course is very superficial, but good for getting used to potentially new terminology.  
- [CISA ICS Virtual Learning Portal.](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/training/ics-virtual-learning-portal)
- [Cyber-security in Industrial Control Systems.](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VAAMI/ICS-modules.pdf)
- On LinkedIn there are a lot of good posts from various individuals. Add for example Mike Holcomb, Robert M. Lee, Shiv Kataria and via their reposts you will find more interesting individuals.

## BOOKS
- "Practical Industrial Cyber Security: ICS, Industry 4.0 & IIoT" by Charles J. Brooks & Philip A. Craig, Jr.
Intended as a study guide for the GICSP exam, this book has a seemingly great reputation among ICS Security professionals.

## NIST PUBLICATIONS
In-depth details, with a lot of good references in the Appendix sections etc.    
- 800-53r5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.  
- 800-61r3, Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management.  
- 800-82r3, Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security.  

## ISA/IEC 62443 STANDARDS
These standards contain in-depth details. Since the material is quite extensive, going through the Quick Start Guide helps with gaining an understanding of how to approach the reading of the standards. The standards below are the ones I found to be most frequently referenced as relevant for the GICSP exam.    
- Quick Start Guide: An Overview of the ISA/IEC 62443 Standards  
- 1-1, Terminology, concepts and models.  
- 2-1, Establishing an industrial automation and control system security program.  
- 3-2, Security risk assessment for system design.  
- 3-3, System security requirements and security levels.  
- 4-1, Secure product development lifecycle requirements.  
- 4-2, Technical security requirements for IACS components.

## YOUTUBE CHANNELS:  
- [Getting Started in ICS/OT Cyber Security with Mike Holcomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCIrntyqe64&list=PLOSJSv0hbPZAlINIh1HcB0L8AZcSPc80g).  
- [SANS ICS Security Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SANSICSSecurity/videos). Search for "ics410" for topics directly related to GICSP.   

# ADDITIONAL MATERIAL
This section is aimed at providing references to material related to ICS that is not vital for the exam preparation.

## WIDERANGING ICS SECURITY RESOURCES
Very good for a constant flow of contemporary resources/events.
