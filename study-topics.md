# CORE MATERIAL
This section is aimed at providing a concise overview of the material that seems the absolutely most relevant/vital for GICSP exam preparation. 

## INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW MATERIAL
The CISA course is very superficial, but good for getting used to potentially new terminology.  
- [CISA ICS Virtual Learning Portal.](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/training/ics-virtual-learning-portal)
- [Cyber-security in Industrial Control Systems.](https://engineering.purdue.edu/VAAMI/ICS-modules.pdf)
- [CISA overview of critical infrastructure sectors](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors). For the exam, it is not required to understand the in-depth differences between the system architectures. Rather, establish a general sense of how they differ.
- On LinkedIn there are a lot of good posts from various individuals. Add for example Mike Holcomb, Robert M. Lee, Shiv Kataria and via their reposts you will find more interesting individuals. Sometimes there are posts about signing up to CTF events or seminars etc.

## BOOKS & CHEATSHEETS
- "Practical Industrial Cyber Security: ICS, Industry 4.0 & IIoT" by Charles J. Brooks & Philip A. Craig, Jr.  
Intended as a study guide for the GICSP exam. Contains 25 practice questions per chapter. Has a seemingly great reputation among ICS Security professionals. Offers a break from the dense reading of NIST and ISA/IEC standards.
- [SANS Cheat Sheet PDFs.](https://www.sans.org/blog/the-ultimate-list-of-sans-cheat-sheets). One frequent GIAC test taker(Hacks4Pancakes) noted: "_Keep those handy SANS cheat sheets for tools, commands, and operating systems they give you in the class, and bring them to the test_".

## NIST PUBLICATIONS
In-depth details, with a lot of good references in the Appendix sections etc.    
- 800-53r5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.  
- 800-61r3, Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management.  
- 800-82r3, Guide to Operational Technology (OT) Security.  

## ISA/IEC 62443 STANDARDS
In-depth details. Since the material is quite extensive, going through the Quick Start Guide helps with gaining an understanding of how to approach the reading of the standards. The standards below are the ones I found to be most frequently referenced by industry professionals as being relevant for the GICSP exam. Additionally, in the 4-2 standard(p.14), it is stated that "_the primary standards for system integrators are ISA‑62443‑2‑1 [5], ISA‑62443‑2‑4 [8], ISA‑62443‑3‑2 [10] and ISA‑62443‑3‑3_". However, since the contents of 2-4 is more directed towards third-parties/service providers than operators, I didn't add it to the list. Of course, the 2-4 information would also be valuable for the exam, but the material added to the reference manual has to be demarked somewhere, in order to ensure that there is a clear focus on the material that is the most vital for the exam focus areas.       
- Quick Start Guide: An Overview of the ISA/IEC 62443 Standards  
- 1-1, Terminology, concepts and models. While a good overview of various topics, the other standards provide more in-depth details. 
- 2-1, Establishing an industrial automation and control system security program.  
- 3-2, Security risk assessment for system design.  
- 3-3, System security requirements and security levels.  

## YOUTUBE CHANNELS:  
- [Getting Started in ICS/OT Cyber Security with Mike Holcomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCIrntyqe64&list=PLOSJSv0hbPZAlINIh1HcB0L8AZcSPc80g).  
- [SANS ICS Security Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SANSICSSecurity/videos). Search for "ics410" for topics directly related to GICSP.   

# ADDITIONAL MATERIAL
This section is aimed at providing references to material related to ICS that is not vital for the exam preparation, but that I want to look into in the future.

## WIDERANGING ICS SECURITY RESOURCES
Very good for a constant flow of contemporary resources/events.  
- [SANS ICS Webinars.](https://www.sans.org/webcasts) Click the "Focus Area" button and check "ICS Security". Industry leaders are presenting during these webinars.
