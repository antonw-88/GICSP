Signals Input:  
Discrete - Binary open/closed  
Analog - analog signal som mäter 0-100%, till exempel flöde.  
Digital - kan mäta båda, men skickar digitalt(ICS protokoll).  
  
Signals Output:  
Discrete - Binär öppna/stäng  
Analog - Analog(ofta elektrisk) signal som justerar actuator/valve/motor.  
Digital - Kan kontrollera elektriska signaler med en dator. Förbättrar hastighet och pålitlighet.  
    
###Processes are designed to change the chemical or physical properties of upstream materials to more useful downstream products. These changes must be monitored and controlled during this transition. Accurate and timely measurements on the physical and chemical properties of the process are crucial to controlling the process, as well as the outcome. These measurements referred to as process data:    
#Process Control.  
#Meet regulatory requirements  
#Track energy costs  
#Provide design inputs for the process enhancements (i.e., identify and justify capital improvements)  
#Control inventory\determine product pricing  

###A control loop, single-loop control is the fundamental building block of industrial control systems. It is communication used to regulate the process. It consists of a group of components working together as a system to achieve and maintain a desired value of a system variable by manipulating the value of another variable in the control loop.
