## Intro discussions

### Key business decision drivers for security decisions
- Supplier<->Customer relationships are long term in the OT space; 20-30-40 years. Can't just change suppliers in same way as in IT.
- Regulations are sector and location specific. The location itself will demand a certain structural implementation(NIS2; NERC CIP; etc).
- Extensive regulations within the OT cybersec space is something relatively new, and will transform the global industry over the coming years.
- Regulations are created in response to specific events. This may leave a gap for events that have not yet occurred.

### Risk assessments
- A paper based assessment is less intrusive, but manual labor intensive. Includes for example:
  - Manual network topology review.
  - Port and service identification.
  - Vulnerability review of assets; rulesets; patch level; default account; SNMP; etc).
- An active assessment applies vendor tools and scripts, but require careful considerations.
