"The major architectural focus of ATT&CK for ICS are the systems and functions associated with functional levels 0 – 2 of the Purdue architecture" - MITRE ATT&CK ® for Industrial Control Systems: Design and Philosophy(Alexander, Otis. Et al. 2020).  

The above document is a very good reference for understanding the structure and motivation of the Mitre ICS ATT&CK framework, but is not that relevant for the GICSP exam. To learn about topics more directly related to the exam objectives, the techniques listed in the [ICS ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/ics/) can be referred to.
