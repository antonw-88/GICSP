generic term and not a protocol.  
#It replaces centralized control networks with distributed control networks  
#Bi-directional – This means it is a duplex port; the data can be transmitted in two directions at the same time.  
#Multi-drop – This is also referred to as multi-access and can be interpreted as a single bus with many nodes connected to it.  
#Serial-bus – This means the data is transmitted in small packets in a sequential manner.  
#Multiple Topologies – Fieldbus works on network structures such as daisy-chain, star, ring, branch, and tree topologies.  
#Sensor Bus network - level 1 - includes the field devices  
#Device bus network - level 2 - all sensor bus networks connected here. VFD and motor control centers connected here.  
#Control bus network - level 3 - High level data comms. Such as PLC and HMI. Control over the network.  
#Info network - All computers, departments. Computer driven level.  
#Two sections -> interconnection(comm protocol) and application(automation function the field bus performs).  
#Fieldbus has no interconnections between networks.
