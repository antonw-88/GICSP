# IEC-61850 overview
IEC 61850 is a standard that provides methodology and modelling of substation automation systems towards a full digital solution. Within IEC 61850, the substation automation system is modeled using the object-oriented method. Each device/equipment has its corresponding object. The relationships of these objects are also well defined. The standard lays a solid foundation for a digital substation system, as well as a smart grid. Substation automation systems (SAS) require certain functions in order to monitor, control, and protect the system. These functions are distributed among the IEDs based on their responsibilities in the system.

## Protocol aspects
- Interoparability focuses on the device level, so there are issues on the system level.
- Focuses on IntelligenElectronicDevices(IED) multi-vendor interoparability.
- Provides a unified language for substation IED configuration: Substation Configuration Language(SCL).
- The Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) control block allows fast and reliable exchange of data from one IED (Publisher) to several peer IEDs (Subscribers) in order for the IEDs to perform a distributed action.
