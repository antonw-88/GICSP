## Example Usecases
- 

#OPC does not represent a network protocol in the traditional sense, but rather a capability to support the interfacing and interconnection with disparate vendor technologies.  
#UA - platform independent service-oriented architecture  
#Another important UA feature is its ability to use structures and models, so data tags or points can be grouped and given context, making governance and maintenance easier.  
#The OPC server supports almost any ICS protocol imaginable, including Modbus, DNP3, ICCP, and Foundation Fieldbus.
