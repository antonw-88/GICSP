# IEC-60870-5-104 overview
IEC-60870-5 and DNP3 provide basically the same functionality. However, DNP3 is based on IEC-60870-5 and provides more advanced functionality. DNP3 is more common in American grids, and IEC-60870-5 in European grids.

## Protocol aspects
- SCADA <-> RTU/IED comms.
- Balanced transmission procedure for SCADA comms:
  - Controller and stations can initiate communication.
  - Stations can act as both controlling and controlled stations simultaneuosly, and are thus called combined stations.
  - Only point-to-point or multiple point-to-point configs.  
-  Unbalanced transmission procedure for SCADA comms:
  - Controller polls outstations sequentially.
  - Controller initiates all message transfers, and outstations can only respond.
- Transmission services:
  - Send/No Reply:
  - Send/Confirm:
  - Request/Respond:  

## Security Weaknesses.
- No authentication.
- No integrity.
- No confidentiality.
- No sequence numbering(could be spoofed anyway since no confidentiality).
- The IEC-62351(a security layer standard for power system protocols) adresses these weaknesses, but many older RTU/IED-devices do not support this security layer. 

## Main Purdue Levels
- Level 1(Field RTU/IED) <-> 2(SCADA).

## Example Usecases
