# IEC-60870-5-104 overview

## Protocol aspects
- Balanced transmission procedure for SCADA comms:
  - Controller and stations can initiate communication.
  - Stations can act as both controlling and controlled stations simultaneuosly, and are thus called combined stations.
  - Only point-to-point or multiple point-to-point configs.  
-  Unbalanced transmission procedure for SCADA comms:
  - Controller polls outstations sequentially.
  - Controller initiates all message transfers, and outstations can only respond.
- Transmission services:
  - Send/No Reply:
  - Send/Confirm:
  - Request/Respond:
