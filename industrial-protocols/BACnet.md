# BACnet overview
Building Automation Control Network.

## Protocol aspects
- Object oriented model where every BACnet device contains a device object that defines certain device information.
- Application services model, where services are formal requests that one BACnet device sends to another BACnet device to ask it to do something.
  - Object access (read, write, create, delete);
  - Device management (discover, time synchronization, initialize, backup and restore database);
  - Alarm and event (alarms and changes of state);
  - File transfer (trend data, program transfer);
  - Virtual terminal (human machine interface via prompts and menus).
- Extensive interoperability design.
- Mainly well known for HVAC applications, but can be applied for a multitude of building automation purposes.
