## Mike Holcomb: Getting Started with Industrial ICS/OT Cyber Security
- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue8JjQigv-4&list=PLOSJSv0hbPZAlINIh1HcB0L8AZcSPc80g&index=2).

## Core concepts mentioned in the SANS course syllabus:  
_The note "chapter" refers to the "Practical Industrial Cyber Security" book._
- [Different industry requirements.](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors)
- IT & ICS Differences - 800-82 section 2 and executive summary.
- Physical Security Topics -> Chapter 6.
- ICS Life Cycle Challenges 
- ICS410 Reference Model 
- Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS) -> chapter 1
- Larger ICS Sites-> Overall understanding from multiple references.

## Notes:
- Main difference between OT and IT -> Human safety is always the primary prioritization(this is contextual, bad chemical mix can be more dangerous than an explosion).
- Closed loop vs other types of loops.
- ICS, more like a LAN(single physical location). SCADA, more like a WAN(systems spread out).
